## <Vietmap.PointAnnotation />
### PointAnnotation represents a one-dimensional shape located at a single geographical coordinate.<br/><br/>Consider using ShapeSource and SymbolLayer instead, if you have many points and you have static images,<br/>they'll offer much better performance<br/><br/>.<br/>If you need interctive views please use MarkerView,<br/>as with PointAnnotation on Android child views are rendered onto a bitmap for better performance.
